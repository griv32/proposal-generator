Date: November 15, 2024
Participants: Michael Chen (CTO, RetailMax Solutions), Jennifer Kim (Sales Director)

Michael: Thanks for taking the time to meet with us today. I'm Michael Chen, CTO at RetailMax Solutions. We're an e-commerce platform serving mid-market retailers.

Jennifer: Great to meet you, Michael. Can you tell me more about the challenges you're facing?

Michael: We're experiencing major performance issues with our current inventory management system. During peak seasons like Black Friday, our system can't handle the load, and we're losing sales due to overselling and stock discrepancies.

Our current system is built on legacy technology from 2018, and it's becoming a bottleneck. We have about 500 retail partners using our platform, and they manage over 100,000 SKUs collectively.

The main issues we need to solve:
- Real-time inventory synchronization across multiple sales channels
- Automated reorder point calculations
- Predictive analytics for demand forecasting
- Integration with existing ERP systems (SAP and Oracle)
- Mobile dashboard for on-the-go inventory management

We're looking to complete this project within 4-5 months, ideally launching before next year's peak season. Our budget is flexible, but we're looking at a range of $300,000 to $450,000.

Our technical environment is primarily AWS-based, using microservices architecture. We need the solution to integrate seamlessly with our existing APIs and maintain 99.9% uptime.

Key success metrics for us would be:
- Reducing inventory discrepancies by 95%
- Improving order fulfillment speed by 40%
- Enabling real-time visibility across all channels
- Supporting 10x traffic growth during peak periods

Jennifer: That's very comprehensive. What would be the biggest impact if we solve these challenges?

Michael: We estimate it could increase our revenue by 25-30% annually just from reduced stockouts and improved customer satisfaction. Our retail partners are also pressuring us to provide better inventory insights.

The solution needs to be scalable because we're planning to onboard 200 more retail partners next year.

Jennifer: Excellent. We'll prepare a detailed proposal covering all these requirements and schedule a follow-up meeting next week to discuss the implementation approach.

Michael: Perfect. Looking forward to seeing how you can help us transform our inventory management.
