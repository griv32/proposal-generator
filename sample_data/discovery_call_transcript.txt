Discovery Call Transcript - RetailMax Solutions
Date: March 15, 2024
Participants: Sales Rep (John), Customer (Sarah Mitchell, CTO at RetailMax Solutions)

John: Good morning Sarah, thank you for taking the time to speak with us today. I understand RetailMax Solutions is looking to modernize your technology infrastructure?

Sarah: That's right, John. We're a mid-sized retail company with about 150 stores across the region, and frankly, our current systems are holding us back. We're still running on legacy POS systems that are nearly 10 years old, and our inventory management is largely manual.

John: I see. What specific challenges are you experiencing with the current setup?

Sarah: Well, the biggest pain point is our POS system. It's slow, unreliable, and crashes frequently - especially during peak hours. Last month alone, we had system downtime that cost us an estimated $50,000 in lost sales. Our staff spend way too much time on manual inventory counts, and we have zero real-time visibility into stock levels across locations.

John: That sounds frustrating. What's driving the urgency to address this now?

Sarah: A few things. First, customer expectations have changed post-COVID. They want seamless omnichannel experiences - buy online, pick up in store, real-time inventory visibility, mobile payments. We can't deliver any of that with our current systems. Second, we're planning to expand by 30 stores next year, and scaling our current manual processes would be a nightmare.

John: Makes sense. Tell me about your budget parameters for this project.

Sarah: We've allocated between $200,000 and $500,000 for this modernization project. The exact amount depends on scope and what we can justify with ROI projections. Our CFO wants to see payback within 18 months.

John: What's your ideal timeline?

Sarah: We need to have this completed by October - that's about 6 months. We want to be fully operational before the holiday shopping season. Any later than that would mean waiting until after the holidays, which isn't acceptable to our board.

John: Understood. What would success look like for RetailMax from this project?

Sarah: Great question. Success means 99.9% system uptime, real-time inventory visibility across all locations, mobile payment capabilities, and integrated online-to-offline customer experiences. We also need PCI DSS compliance - that's non-negotiable given we handle credit card data. From an efficiency standpoint, we want to reduce manual inventory time by at least 70%.

John: Those are clear success metrics. What about your team's readiness for this change?

Sarah: We have a good IT team of 8 people, but they're mostly focused on keeping current systems running. We'll definitely need training and probably some additional support during the transition. Change management is always a concern - our store managers have been using the same systems for years.

John: Who else is involved in this decision-making process?

Sarah: The final decision involves myself, our CFO Mark Rodriguez, and our VP of Operations Lisa Chen. We've already gotten board approval for the budget range I mentioned. Mark will want to see detailed ROI projections, and Lisa will focus on operational impact and training requirements.

John: Are there any specific compliance or security requirements beyond PCI DSS?

Sarah: Yes, we need to ensure all customer data is properly encrypted and we're compliant with state data protection laws. We also want audit trails for all transactions and inventory changes. Given some of our locations are in California, CCPA compliance is important too.

John: What concerns do you have about this project?

Sarah: Honestly, my biggest worry is disruption during the transition. We can't afford extended downtime, especially not during back-to-school or holiday seasons. I'm also concerned about user adoption - if the new system is too complex, we'll face resistance from our staff.

John: That's completely understandable. Have you looked at other solutions or vendors?

Sarah: We've had preliminary conversations with two other vendors, but we're really looking for a partner who understands retail operations and can provide comprehensive support throughout the implementation and beyond.

John: Based on everything you've shared, I think we can definitely help RetailMax achieve these goals. Our retail modernization solutions have helped similar companies improve uptime to 99.95% and reduce inventory management time by up to 80%.

Sarah: That sounds promising. What would be the next steps?

John: I'd like to propose a more detailed discovery session where our technical team can assess your current infrastructure in detail. From there, we can provide a comprehensive proposal with timeline, investment details, and ROI projections. Would you be open to scheduling that for next week?

Sarah: Absolutely. Let's set that up. I'll make sure Mark and Lisa can join that session as well.

John: Perfect. I'll send over some calendar options and a brief agenda for the technical discovery session. Thank you for your time today, Sarah.

Sarah: Thank you, John. Looking forward to seeing what you propose.
